# Image-sharing Class-based Django App

##### A simple Django-powered app allowing anyone to share images and view them.

*The limitations of this app are that it does not use a user authentication system, does not allow deletion of posts without using Django admin, and has little interactivity (i.e. comments, private messages etc).*

However, it was a good starting point for learning Django; the concepts learned have been taken further in [a subsequent Django app I created](https://github.com/B-Lenton/django-TIL).
